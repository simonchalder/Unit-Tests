# Unit-Tests

A simple project to practice unit testing in C# .NET using Xunit

So far the project tests the following kinds of assertations:

 - Equal

 - True

 - Throws Exception

**To-do**

As my knowledge of .NET, C#, and testing grows I will return here to create new scenarios and run new forms of tests.
